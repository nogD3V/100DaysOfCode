#We need to make a program that prints the numbers of characters in a user's name.

name = input('What is your name?')
print(len(name))

#We need to put exactly how is on the exercise or It'll not work, but I would like to put like this:

#name = input('Put your name here to see how much characters there is: ')
#print(len(name))
