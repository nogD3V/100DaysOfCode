# The code cames like this:

#Fix the code below ðŸ‘‡

# print(''Day 1 - String Manipulation")
# print('String Concatenation is done with the '+' sign.')
#     print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
# print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n."))

#And I debug to this one:

print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
